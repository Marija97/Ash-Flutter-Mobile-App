A new Flutter application.

## Objective:

The Ash project initially aims to cater to my individual requirements, with a particular focus on organizing media feature.
Additionally it will serve as a platform for showcasing my evolving development skills and expanding my knowledge in the field.

## Technology Stack:

For the mobile app development aspect, I have chosen to use Flutter, a versatile framework known for its efficiency in creating cross-platform mobile applications.
On the backend, I'm planning to employ Node.js, a popular and scalable runtime environment for server-side applications.

Ash is being designed as a comprehensive platform with the core purpose of capturing and preserving cherished memories.
Its features encompass the ability to save, organize, and share photos and videos within user-created albums.

There is a long-term vision for Ash to become a full-fledged social media platform, where users can not only store their memories but also connect with others, fostering a sense of community and engagement.

In summary, the Ash project represents an exciting journey of personal growth and skill development in the world of mobile and backend development, as well as a platform that will address needs for collecting and saving memories for potentially significant number of users around the world.
